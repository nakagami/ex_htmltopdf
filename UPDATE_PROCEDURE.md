# ExHtmltopdf Update Procedure

Run this procedure periodically to pull upstream sghtmltopdf changes and
update ExHtmltopdf.

## Overview

ExHtmltopdf pins a specific sghtmltopdf git revision in
`native/ex_htmltopdf/Cargo.toml` (`sghtmltopdf-core` is not published to
crates.io — same situation as ExMonty/monty). This procedure walks through
pulling, assessing, and integrating changes.

**Track tagged releases, not `main`.** Upstream cuts `v0.x.y` tags; target the
latest tag unless the user explicitly asks to chase `main`.

The upstream checkout lives at `../sghtmltopdf` relative to this project root.

---

## Phase 1: Pull and Assess

### 1.1 Fetch latest upstream and find the latest tag

```bash
cd ../sghtmltopdf && git fetch origin --tags
git tag --sort=-version:refname | head -5
```

Pick the highest tag. That's the **target rev** for this update.

### 1.2 Identify our current pin

```bash
grep 'rev = ' native/ex_htmltopdf/Cargo.toml
cd ../sghtmltopdf && git describe --tags <OUR_PINNED_REV>
```

### 1.3 Review changes since our pin

Our contract with upstream is narrower than ExMonty's — almost everything
flows through the shared CLI parser. Review, in order of importance:

```bash
cd ../sghtmltopdf

# 1. The option surface (this IS our API — new/renamed/removed flags flow
#    straight through Options.to_argv/1 to users):
git diff <OUR_PINNED_REV>..<TARGET_TAG> -- \
  core/src/cli/options.rs core/src/cli/unsupported.rs

# 2. The functions we call directly:
git diff <OUR_PINNED_REV>..<TARGET_TAG> -- \
  core/src/cli/mod.rs core/src/cli/convert.rs core/src/sink/mod.rs

# 3. Engine surfaces backing security-relevant options:
git diff <OUR_PINNED_REV>..<TARGET_TAG> -- \
  core/src/engine.rs core/src/img core/src/fonts

# 4. What the Ruby binding had to change (they hit our problems first):
git log --oneline <OUR_PINNED_REV>..<TARGET_TAG> -- bindings/ruby
```

We call exactly: `cli::parse_convert_argv`, `cli::with_render_stack`,
`cli::CliError` (all four variants), `convert::render`,
`convert::render_to_memory`, `sink::{MemorySink, FileSink}`, and
`layout::PageSettings` (smoke probe). A change to any of their signatures is
a breaking change for us.

For every update, explicitly re-check these invariants rather than relying
on compilation:

- `parse_convert_argv` still expects `argv[0]` to be a program name, and `-`
  input still requires `--output` (our `Options.to_argv/1` prefix depends on
  both);
- `FileSink` still writes temp-file-then-rename (our "no truncated PDF"
  doc promise);
- remote asset fetching is still default-off; local file access defaults and
  `--allow` containment semantics unchanged (README security section);
- `CliError` variants still map 1:1 to our `Error.kind`s;
- `with_render_stack`'s stack size still covers the engine's recursion needs
  (upstream owns this, but a removal/rename breaks us loudly — good).

### 1.4 New CLI flags = free features

New flags work through `Options.to_argv/1` with zero code changes. Still:
mention notable ones in the README options list and CHANGELOG so Elixir
users can discover them.

---

## Phase 2: Update

### 2.1 Switch to a path dependency for development

Edit `native/ex_htmltopdf/Cargo.toml`:

```toml
# sghtmltopdf-core = { git = "https://github.com/waka/sghtmltopdf.git", rev = "...", default-features = false, features = ["cli"] }
sghtmltopdf-core = { path = "../../../sghtmltopdf/core", default-features = false, features = ["cli"] }
```

### 2.2 Build, fix, test

```bash
cd native/ex_htmltopdf && cargo check
cd ../.. && EXHTMLTOPDF_BUILD=1 mix test
```

If upstream changed rendered output (not API), some assertions may need
updating — prefer structural assertions (`<<"%PDF-", _::binary>>`, error
kinds) over golden bytes, so this stays rare.

### 2.3 Update docs

New flags or changed defaults → README options list, `ExHtmltopdf`
moduledoc (especially the security posture section), CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]`.

---

## Phase 3: Pin and Ship

### 3.1 Switch back to the git dependency

```toml
sghtmltopdf-core = { git = "https://github.com/waka/sghtmltopdf.git", rev = "<FULL_40_CHAR_HASH>", default-features = false, features = ["cli"] }
```

Use the full hash of the commit the **target tag** points at
(`git rev-parse <TARGET_TAG>^{commit}`) — a hash can't silently move if a
tag is force-updated.

### 3.2 Verify a clean build from the git dep

```bash
cd native/ex_htmltopdf && cargo update -p sghtmltopdf-core
cd ../.. && mix clean && EXHTMLTOPDF_BUILD=1 mix test
```

### 3.3 CHANGELOG + commit

```
Update sghtmltopdf to <short-hash> (<tag>)

- <breaking changes fixed>
- <new flags now available>
- <upstream improvements picked up>
```

---

## Release

Run `just release` (interactive: bumps mix.exs, rolls the CHANGELOG, tags,
pushes). The tag push triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`:

1. builds the 4 target NIFs and attaches them to a GitHub release;
2. the `publish` job (gated on approval of the `hex` GitHub environment)
   regenerates `checksum-Elixir.ExHtmltopdf.Native.exs` from the released
   artifacts via `mix rustler_precompiled.download ExHtmltopdf.Native
   --all --print`, then publishes to Hex.

The checksum file must come from the *released* artifacts — never commit one
generated from a local build (the ExMonty 0.4.0 re-tag lesson).

## When to Update

- **When upstream cuts a new tag** — the natural cadence.
- **Immediately** if upstream fixes a bug affecting us (chase `main` or wait
  for the next tag depending on severity — ask the user).
- **Before any ExHtmltopdf release** to pick up the latest stable tag.
